===========================

A game.

Hi, I wanted to try out Github, and I wanted to be able to work on this project individually and share my edits with you. Could you share the existing code with me?

Pretty sure this is NOT what is meant to go into a readme, but fuck it, I'm a beginner :P

I'm going to build the whole Mall, with no story/mobs/items, just to get the rooms connected up. This means duplicating some of what we already did.
I can't remember how we fixed the if/else bug, so I might be writing entirely broken code from the outset! YAY! :D

I'm also going to make bananabread outta all your bananas. kthnxbai
